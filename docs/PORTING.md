# Porting bmdwire to Go: decisions

This file is the decision log for the port. Each section says what was
decided and why, so a later session can follow it instead of re-deriving
it. When you make a new decision, add it here in the same commit.

## Source of truth

- The port follows **bmdwire v1.3.0** (`github.com/lucas-romanenko/bmdwire`,
  tag `v1.3.0`, commit `cea58c2`). Cite that tag wherever the port refers
  to bmdwire, in comments and docs alike, so a reader knows which version a
  claim was checked against.
- `docs/SURFACE-atem.md` is atemwire's own inventory, copied verbatim with a
  header naming the tag. It is the specification for `atem/`. Its body says
  it describes 1.2.0; every fix it marks as made after 1.2.0 (§5.4) is in
  v1.3.0, so it describes v1.3.0 apart from those marks.
- Where SURFACE.md and the Python code disagree, the code at v1.3.0 wins,
  as SURFACE.md itself says. Each disagreement found during the port is
  listed under "SURFACE.md and the code" at the end of this file.
- **Mirror, don't redesign.** Behaviour, masks, clamps, units and quirks
  follow atemwire, including its known traps (SURFACE.md §5.4), unless a
  section below says otherwise. A deliberate difference is recorded here
  with its reason; an undocumented difference is a bug.

## Repository rules

- Module `github.com/lucas-romanenko/bmdctl`, Go 1.27.
- Device packages (`atem`, `hyperdeck`, `videohub`, `ultimatte`) use the
  standard library only. `golang.org/x/image` is allowed later for image
  fitting (still upload) and nowhere else.
- One commit per step of the plan, conventional commit messages, pushed
  after every commit. `go build ./... && go vet ./... && go test ./...` is
  green at every commit.
- The hardware rule (see `CLAUDE.md`): nothing contacts a real switcher
  unless built with `-tags hardware`; hardware tests take the target from
  `BMDCTL_TEST_ATEM`, accept only `192.168.81.85` and `192.168.81.86`, are
  read-only unless `BMDCTL_TEST_WRITE=1`, and never change the video mode,
  clear stills, restore a profile or save startup state. This phase has no
  hardware tests: everything runs against `internal/fixtures` or
  `internal/fakeatem`.
- Out of scope until asked: transfers (stills, macros), the macro bytecode
  codec, profiles, a background engine, hosts, HTTP, MCP, and the HyperDeck,
  Videohub and Ultimatte packages beyond their `doc.go`.

## Licensing

- `atem/` is a port of atemwire, which is LGPL-3.0-only (a fork of pyatem),
  so it is LGPL-3.0-only too. `atem/LICENSE` and `atem/LICENSE-gpl3.txt`
  are copied from bmdwire; `atem/NOTICE` gives the lineage. Every file in
  `atem/` starts with both copyright lines and the SPDX identifier.
- `internal/fixtures/` holds bytes and files copied from atemwire's test
  suite, so it carries atemwire's licence as well.
- Everything else (the CLI, the other device packages, `internal/table`,
  `internal/fakeatem`) is MIT, as bmdwire's non-ATEM packages are.

## Fixtures (`internal/fixtures`)

- The fixtures are bmdwire v1.3.0's own test data, copied raw: every packet
  and bytecode literal in `atemwire/tests/*.py`, the profile XML golden and
  the two `build_full_state` snapshots. Where a test builds a byte string
  from an expression, the file holds what the expression evaluates to. The
  README there names the test file and test for each, and whether the test
  calls it a live capture.
- bmdwire's tests contain only three recorded state packets (`MOCP`,
  `AMLP`, `AMBP`); the other tests build payloads with `struct.pack` inside
  the test. Those are not fixtures; the Go tests port them as code.
- The package embeds the directory and exposes `fixtures.Bytes(t, path)`.
  A test fails if any file is empty or missing from the README.
- Fixtures are LGPL-3.0-only, like the tests they came from.

## Transport (`atem/transport.go`)

Mirrors bmdwire v1.3.0 `atemwire/transport.py` (`Packet`, `UdpProtocol`):
UDP 9910; SYN with hello `0x01` under session `0x1337`, the switcher's SYN
answer (`0x02` accepted) ACKed, the session id then taken from the
switcher's next packet; the contiguous ACK high-water mark; dedup of
flagged retransmissions; in-order delivery with up to 512 packets parked
ahead of a gap; go-back-N resends only when the switcher asks (from header
bytes 6-7, at most 128, window 4096); the goodbye (SYN, hello `0x04`, only
when established); 15-bit sequence arithmetic throughout. No client
keepalive and no client retransmit timer, as in atemwire.

- **No thread.** atemwire splits the transport between a UDP thread
  (`_receive_packet_low`, `_send_packet_low`) and the protocol worker
  (`receive_packet`). Here both are methods on one struct called only from
  the session's owner goroutine (step 3), so it has no locks and no queues.
  It never reads the socket: the session hands it each datagram
  (`receive`), then each packet that comes out (`handle`).
- **ACKs go out immediately.** atemwire queues an ACK for its UDP thread to
  send on its next `select()` wake-up; here it is written while the
  datagram is processed. Same ACK number, same order relative to the data.
- **"5 s of silence" means what atemwire's `select()` means:** no datagram
  in from anyone (a foreign or malformed one counts) and no packet out
  through the normal send path, for 5 s. Resends and the goodbye bypass
  that path in atemwire, so they don't count here either. A client that
  keeps sending commands to a dead switcher therefore never times out, as
  in atemwire. On timeout the transport re-SYNs at once and the session
  reports a disconnect.
- **ConnectionReady without a stash.** atemwire marks the dump complete
  when `InCm` is stored, then returns a `ConnectionReady` sentinel for the
  next packet and keeps that packet for its next call (the 2026-09-16
  stash fix). `handle` reports `ready` and the packet's data together; the
  session acts on `ready` first, so the order is the same. As in atemwire,
  `connect` does not clear the mark.
- **Send errors.** `TRANSIENT_SEND_ERRNOS` (ENETUNREACH, EHOSTUNREACH,
  ECONNREFUSED, ENOBUFS, EAGAIN, EPERM, EINTR) drop the packet and the
  session carries on; as in atemwire the dropped packet uses up no sequence
  number. Any other write error is returned and ends the session: it is
  what kills atemwire's UDP thread. On Windows Go's `syscall` errnos are
  invented values, so a Winsock error may be treated as fatal there; the
  caller dials again. A packet sent while the session id is unknown is
  dropped, which is what atemwire's `to_bytes` failure does.
- **Foreign-peer guard** compares IP addresses. atemwire compares the
  sender's address string with the `ip` it was given; the session resolves
  a host name once when dialling, so a name works here.
- **A SYN with no hello byte** is ignored with a warning; atemwire raises
  `IndexError` out of `loop()`, which loses the packet the same way.
- **The SYN** carries sequence number 1 (`local_sequence_number` goes from
  -1 to 0 first) and zero in bytes 8-9, exactly as atemwire sends it.
- **Not ported yet:** the paced bulk send queue (`queue_packet`,
  `queue_trigger`, `batch_size` 5 / 3 ms, `aggressive_drain`, the
  `TransferQueueFlushed` sentinel). Only uploads use it; it arrives with
  transfers. `Wakeup` has no counterpart: the session's owner goroutine
  wakes on channels.
- **Logging.** `ATEMWIRE_PACKET_TRACE` is not read. The transport logs to a
  `*slog.Logger` (discarded by default): per-packet detail at debug,
  recoveries at warn, timeouts and dropped packets at error.
- **Tests** port `test_transport_ack_gap.py`, `test_transport_inorder.py`,
  `test_transport_connect_reset.py`, `test_transport_datagram_guard.py`,
  `test_transport_retransmit.py`, `test_transport_close_session.py` and the
  transport half of `test_lock_delivery.py` one for one against a fake
  `net.PacketConn`, using the `transport/` fixtures where the Python tests
  use those literals. Python tests with no counterpart say why in a comment
  where they would be.
